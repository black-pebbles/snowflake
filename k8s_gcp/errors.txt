1. the following error was faced while creating a 3 node cluster.

module.gke.google_container_node_pool.pools["default-node-pool"]: Creating...
╷
│ Error: error creating NodePool: googleapi: Error 403: Insufficient regional quota to satisfy request: resource "IN_USE_ADDRESSES": request requires '9.0' and is short '1.0'. project has a quota of '8.0' with '8.0' available.

the issue was due to quotas.

Solution: Temporarily, I'm going ahead with 2 node cluster. Each node requires 3 static IP addresses, hence in total 9 are required.
With 2 node, a total of 2 static addresses will be needed, to deal with this problem.

Ideally, in a production setup, a quorum is required in odd numbers.
